# Vehicle Suspension and Vibrations Analysis 

##  Project Overview
This project focuses on modeling and analyzing vehicle suspension vibrations through mathematical models and numerical simulations. The study aims to evaluate system stability and passenger comfort by estimating critical dynamic parameters.

##  Engineering & Analysis Tasks
- **Mathematical Modeling:** Derived equations of motion for the suspension system with and without external excitation.
- **Parameter Estimation:** Estimated spring stiffness ($k$), damping coefficients ($c$), and system mass ($m$).
- **Numerical Simulation:** Used **MATLAB** to simulate system response and visualize vibration behavior under road conditions.
- **Dynamic Analysis:** Analyzed the system's reaction to various inputs to ensure optimal performance.

##  Repository Structure
- **`/MATLAB`**: Simulation scripts (.m files) and system response plots.
- **`/Documentation`**: Detailed reports on the mathematical derivations and findings.
- **`/Media`**: Visual representations of the suspension model and simulation results.
